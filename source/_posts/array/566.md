## 题目

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

Example 1:

``` Example
Input:
nums =
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output:
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
```

Note:

``` Note
The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
The given r and c are all positive.
```

## 分析

将一个矩阵（OriR\*OriC）重塑成一个行列乘积相同但行列值不一定相同的矩阵(r\*c)，按照顺序依次填入新的矩阵。
对于新的矩阵有：(行数\*OriC+列数)/c=新行数 (行数\*OriC+列数)%c=新列数

## 题解

1. 新建一个二维数组，将数字依次填入即可。

``` java
class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {
        int oriR = nums.length;
        int oriC = nums[0].length;
        
        if (oriR * oriC != r * c)
            return nums;
        if (oriR == r && oriC == c)
            return nums;
        
        int[][] reshapedNums = new int[r][c];
        for (int i = 0; i < oriR; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < oriC; j++) {
                reshapedNums[(i*oriC+j)/c][(i*oriC+j)%c] = nums[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return reshapedNums;
    }
}
```
